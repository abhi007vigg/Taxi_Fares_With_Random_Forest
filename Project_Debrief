# Taxi_Fares_With_Random_Forest
In this project,I work with the data from a large number of taxi journeys in New York from 2013. 
I will use regression trees and random forests to predict the value of fares and tips, based on location, date and time.
The dataset used in this project is a sample from the complete 2013 NYC taxi data, which was originally obtained and 
published by Chris Whong.
